## Learning Objectives

### Collaborative Development
- Create and configure GitHub repositories
- Master branching and pull request workflows
- Implement effective code review practices

### Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals
- Set up local Terraform environment
- Configure Azure integration
- Create and manage basic cloud resources
- Deploy networks and virtual machines

### Advanced Infrastructure Management
- Implement disaster recovery procedures
- Master state management and version control
- Design scalable infrastructure using modules
- Optimize configurations for reusability

By the end of this workshop series, you will have progressed from basic collaborative coding to advanced infrastructure management, gaining practical experience in using Terraform with Azure cloud infrastructure. You'll be equipped with the skills to contribute to projects, manage code collaboratively, and implement sophisticated infrastructure automation.
